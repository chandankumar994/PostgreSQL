## 1. Introduction to Databases
- **What is a Database?**
  - A structured collection of data.
  - Used to store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently.
- **Types of Databases**
  - Relational vs Non-Relational (SQL vs NoSQL).
- **Why Use Databases?**
  - Efficiency, data integrity, scalability, and security.
- **Popular Database Systems**
  - MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.
  
## 2. Introduction to PostgreSQL
- **What is PostgreSQL?**
  - Open-source, advanced object-relational database system.
- **Features of PostgreSQL**
  - ACID compliance, scalability, and extensibility.
    Let me break down these terms in simple, everyday language:

      ### **ACID Compliance**
      - **A** stands for **Atomicity**: Imagine you're transferring money from one bank account to another. If something goes wrong during the transfer (like the internet cuts out), the system will make sure either the entire transfer happens or none of it does. It’s all or nothing—no half-done tasks.
      - **C** is for **Consistency**: After any operation (like adding or updating information), the database makes sure that everything still follows the rules. Think of it like a puzzle where every piece fits perfectly. If a wrong piece tries to fit in, the system won’t allow it.
      - **I** means **Isolation**: If multiple people are working on the database at the same time (like two tellers processing transactions), they won’t mess up each other’s work. Each transaction happens as if it’s the only one, even if many are running together.
      - **D** stands for **Durability**: Once the system says something is saved, it's saved forever—even if the power goes out or the system crashes. It’s like writing something down on paper instead of just thinking about it.
      
      ### **Scalability**
      - Scalability means PostgreSQL can handle both small and huge amounts of data. Whether you’re running a database for a local bakery or for a giant company like Amazon, PostgreSQL can expand or shrink based on your needs, without slowing down too much.
      
      ### **Extensibility**
      - Extensibility means that PostgreSQL is flexible and can be customized. Just like adding apps to your phone, you can add new features to PostgreSQL if needed, like special data types or custom functions that make it work exactly how you want for your specific project.
      
      In short, PostgreSQL is like a powerful, flexible, and reliable tool that can grow with your needs, and it makes sure that data is always safe and handled correctly.
- **Installation and Setup**
  - Install PostgreSQL on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux).

## 3. Database Design
- **Data Models**
  - ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagrams).
  - Primary keys, Foreign keys, and Indexes.
- **Normalization**
  - First, Second, Third Normal Form.
  - Denormalization.
- **Relationships in Databases**
  - One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many.
  
## 4. SQL Basics
- **Introduction to SQL**
  - SQL Syntax.
  - Data Definition Language (DDL).
  - Data Manipulation Language (DML).
- **Basic SQL Commands**
  - `CREATE`, `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.
- **Querying Data**
  - Basic SELECT queries.
  - Filtering data using `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`.
  - Sorting data using `ORDER BY`.
  - Limiting results using `LIMIT`.

## 5. Advanced SQL Queries
- **Aggregate Functions**
  - `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`.
- **JOINs**
  - Inner Join, Left Join, Right Join, Full Join.
- **Subqueries**
  - Nested queries.
- **Grouping and Aggregating Data**
  - `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`.
  
## 6. PostgreSQL Features
- **Data Types in PostgreSQL**
  - Integers, Text, Boolean, JSON, Arrays.
- **Constraints and Indexes**
  - NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, PRIMARY KEY.
  - Creating indexes for performance optimization.
- **Sequences and Auto-Increment**
  - Generating unique IDs automatically.
- **Views**
  - Creating virtual tables with `CREATE VIEW`.
  
## 7. Database Administration
- **User Management**
  - Creating users, assigning roles.
- **Database Backup and Restore**
  - Using `pg_dump` and `pg_restore`.
- **Performance Tuning**
  - Query optimization.
  - Understanding EXPLAIN plans.
- **Handling Transactions**
  - BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK.
  - ACID properties.
  
## 8. Best Practices
- **Security Best Practices**
  - Role-based access control.
  - Data encryption.
- **Writing Efficient SQL Queries**
  - Avoiding common performance pitfalls.
- **Database Design Best Practices**
  - Proper use of indexes, normalization, and partitioning.
